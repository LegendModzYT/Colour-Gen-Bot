## Simple Colour Generating Bot With An Added BTC Price Status in GBP.

- This was coded by [Legend][legend] in Python 3.8.

- This bot is a small bot that generates colours in decimal and in hex format for most uses. It's primary use was to be for my Discord embed tool but I decided to make it usable for discord owners therefore the hex format of the colour to directly paste into the role colour box.

### How To Self Host This Bot Yourself.

- Make sure to run the update.bat to install the requirements for the bot.
- Make sure to put your token, prefix, owner id in config.json otherwise the bot may not work correctly.
- To get your owner ID go to `Discord > User Settings > Appearance > Developer Mode` with this enabled right click your username in a chat or role list and click copy ID.
- To get your token you need to go [here][devlink] and create an application then create bot account. From there copy your bot token, Easy.
- Then you run the `run.bat` this should load the bot with all needed information like; Bot Username, Bot ID, Bot Token, Bot Invite Link that is easy to copy.
- If you get an error about not having Python 3.8 but you have installed it, google how to set python 3.8 to PATH.


## If you use this bot please don't say you created it, give credit where it's due.
